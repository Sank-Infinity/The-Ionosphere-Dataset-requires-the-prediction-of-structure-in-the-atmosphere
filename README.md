# The-Ionosphere-Dataset-requires-the-prediction-of-structure-in-the-atmosphere
Using the given data set we are going to predict the structure of the atmosphere whether good or bad.

- In this tutorial we are going to predict atmospher condition whether good or bad based on provided data.
- Here we have 34 independent variables and one depedent variable. 
- For solving this perticular problem we are going to use LogisticRegression.
